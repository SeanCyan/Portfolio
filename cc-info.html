            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>I was tasked with creating a website & logo for a (very) dog friendly coffee shop to be based in Seaham. The client was very hands off and although I checked in often to ensure they liked the direction it was heading, they were happy to let me do my own thing.</p>

                <h3>Website</h3>
                <p>For the website I went with a constrasting theme which is utilised throughout the site. The base color scheme is very monochrome with black & white background images and menu bars, which is offset with pastel colored elements on each page such as the 'about' sections, and the menu. I feel this colour scheme offers an upmarket look while still feeling friendly and inviting.</p>
                <p>I utilised Vue.js to create the image gallery as well as the revolving menu which I felt nicely highlighted the dual purpose of the shop.</p>

            <h3>Logo</h3>
            <p>The logo was drawn in Krita and features a beagle in a sketched style. Originally it was intended to be a rough concept of what the logo could look like, however the client fell in love with the hand drawn look of it and requested we use it as is. Being quite a fun and playful logo, I wanted a font to match and went with Pompiere from Google Fonts.</p>
